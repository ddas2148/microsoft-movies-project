    "Business Problem:\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. Exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. Translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Results/ recommendation:\n",
    "After looking at above findings below are the recommendation:\n",
    "1)\tIt is better to create a movie with mixed genres with high ratings and voting rate \n",
    "2)\t Adventure, animation, comedy and drama could be a good mix\n",
    "3)\tAlways need more attention for voting and good ratings\n",
    "4)\tMedian budget and movie runtime have around 100mins are got better ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Limitation: current data set does not have any data after 2018 whereas unable identify current movie trend. \n",
    "If we can predict other different channel like Netflix, Binge, Amazon prime and launch into their it could reach more people and have different impact!\n",
